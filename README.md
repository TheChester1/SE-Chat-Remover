# SE-Chat-Remover
This is a very simple project I made specifically for myself. It most definitly will not work for anyone.
I don't know what I'm doing and guessing my way making it work. I will not be maintaining it at all and or updating. 
Feel free to use at your own discretion. I hold no responsibility for what happens if you choose to use this. 
It's only a few lines of code I made to see if I could do it. 

A simple chrome extension to remove the chat element and resize video player for a specific streameast mirror. 

Finds and removes the chat element upon loading stream page. No option to turn back on. You need to disable extension if you want to turn it back on.
Also makes the player larger when clicking on the theater mode button. I hard set this to a pixel size as it was easy and wasn't dealing with padding 
on a website like streameast. Again I have no idea what I'm doing. I stumbled my way through this enough to do what I wanted it to. But the Theater Mode 
button does work! Go me.
